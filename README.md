## Quick start

This application is aimed to facilitate your invetory tracking whether it is at home or within your business

## Guide

**Note: In order to use this app you must have internet connection availalble, which will facilitate the retrieval of information from the database.**

To run the application, you must:
  - Install TestFlight (on iOS devices)
  - Log in with your AppleId
  - Request to be added as a Testing User to the developer at gihozo@ualberta.ca
  - Once the verification code has been received, download the app onto your phone and submit any bugs via the testflight form or over here
  
Alternative:
  - You can also download this git repository on your machine (please ensure to have Flutter installed) and run the code manually either using VSCODE, xCode or Android Studio.
  - Main has the last stable release
  
Data Set-Up:
  - The Database contain initial data! If you wish to add more content to the database, please contact the developer, and they will give you temporary edit         access to it.
  
  

 
 **Note: For purposes of testing, data was manually added onto the database for easy retrieval of that information**


## Bugs + Expansion Work

 - Search function within the Tool Box screen (function was initially implemented, however, the view was not reseting based on the user search)
 - Notification when an item is low (meaning the quantity <= to 2)
 - Capability to add/remove items from the app
 - Web interace making it easier to add/remove the data in the back-end
