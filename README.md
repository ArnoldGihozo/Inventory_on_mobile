## Quick start

This is an app aimed at  pursuing and simplifying the shopping process, giving you a personal shopping assistant right on your phone. The purpose of this app was aimed at resolving an issue we found due to covid-19, to prevent less items from travelling from hand to hand.

## Guide

**Note: In order to use this app you must give the app permission to use your camera, which you will be prompted to do so.**
 First, you will have to open your app in order to go through shoppers experience. Then you can begin scanning items in a grocery store (which we would personally recommend using QR codes).
 
 **Note: For purposes of testing we use an excel sheet in order to demonstrate it proficiency**
Click onto the add item, which will ask for camera access. Then scan your QR code and then get the item name and price. You will then receive a total stating how much your groceries will cost.

## Bugs and feature requests

 - When items are dismissed the total price counter needs to be updated, to show the new total.
